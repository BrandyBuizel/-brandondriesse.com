					<h3>Endless Summer Lovin'</h3>
					<p>This collab featured on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@newgrounds">Newgrounds YouTube Channel</a> was the result of an <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/bbs/topic/1506000">Animation Jam Contest</a> I hosted in August of 2022. Entrants had three weeks to create a loop that carries positive summer vibes. We received over 100 submissions to the jam and in the end I compiled and edited a music video using the best 60 entries to <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/1156320">the extended version of "summer breeze"</a>. It takes a lot of care, attention to rhythm, and pacing to create a charming music video you can watching endlessly. Quite a few comments mention rewatching this video several times over, so I feel that I succeeded.</p>
					<h4>I also created the first shot of the music video as an <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/art/view/brandybuizel/summer-lovin-jam">example entry</a> for jam participants.</h4>

					<h3>LUCKYBOY</h3>
					<h4>My senior thesis film at SCAD; directed by <a href="https://linktr.ee/domrom">Domenic Romano</a> and produced by myself and <a href="https://www.amandaanimations.com/">Amanda Castillo</a>.</h4>
					<p>In addition to all my other credits on the film I acted as the sole editor and compositor for the full runtime of LUCKYBOY</a>. Even though Dom and I worked closely during every aspect of production he trusted me to freely make editing decisions on my own, such as adding or cutting entire shots, knowing that we shared the same vision for the final product.</p>

					<h3>Never-Ending Dance Party</h3>
					<p>This collaboration came from another <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/collection/neverendingdancejam">Animation Jam</a> that I hosted on Newgrounds in 2021 where participants had one week to create a dance loop, using any characters, using the same sample from the song <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/audio/listen/1063277">"Plug and Play"</a>. I compiled and edited a music video using the full song after the jam concluded with my favorite entries. The experience was highly rewarding and had an overwhelmingly positive reception on the website which inspired the Endless Summer Lovin' Animation Jam above.</p>
					<h4>Here's the <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/810705">example entry</a> I whipped up to inspire jam participants in one day.</h4>

					<h3>Sugar Please!</h3>
					<p>I co-directed this short with <a href="https://www.ellsketchlr.com/">Ellie Powell</a> for a group film at SCAD in our junior year. Production had to be completed from start to finish in under 10 weeks: Ellie was in charge of the storyboarding process since the film was based on her original pitch and left the animatic timing and foley to me.</p>

					<h3>It's Purple</h3>
					<p>My submission to this <a href="https://www.newgrounds.com/collection/thepurpleimpostor">Animation Jam</a> in 2020 was created start-to-finish entirely by myself in under 48 hours. Based on the popular game Among Us, this animation turns the focus on a player trying to play the game alone. Although the final product uses some storyboard panels to fill the gaps... the animatic and scratch dialogue/sfx work really well for production, especially with a short turnaround time.</p>
